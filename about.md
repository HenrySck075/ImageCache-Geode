Casual users should not install this mod. It does nothing unless something like Level Thumbnails uses this (uhm)

In other words, this mod **DOES NOT** automatically caches every images made by other mods without them depending on this. I'm not doing that.

# How to use
See the mod's README.md on the repository for the usage

## but i dont wanna clog up my disk space with image caches :(
dont worry you are the one who is doing that to yourself

but fr if you want to increase/decrease the cache duration, there's an option for that in the mod settings!

# Limitations
- If someone decides to implement an api where you pass the arguments to get the images in the header, then yeah.
  - Whoever does that should disconnect themselves from internet imo
- You have to manually delete the caches in the mod's save directory if you wanted to
